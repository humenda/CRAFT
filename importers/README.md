This directory contains importer scripts for the various supported corpora. Each
of the *.py files (except for common.py) can be executed without arguments and
will print usage information.
A python installation with at least python 3.4 is required.

If a script is contained in a subdirectory, it can only be used for obtaining
texts in that particular language.
